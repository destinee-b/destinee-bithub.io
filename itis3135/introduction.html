        I am 26 years old and originally from Tennessee. I am a first generation
        college student. I moved to North Carolina in 2021 to Wilmington, then
        to Charlotte in 2023. My interest in Technology came from my childhood,
        and I decided getting a degree in Computer Science was the best way to
        further my passion and goals.

        I am a senior at UNCC and graduate in Spring 2025. I have completed 2
        internships for Computer Science. My first internship was Software
        Development for a local logistics company where I assisted with creation
        and implentation of an API on a larger production scale. I gained an
        in-depth understanding of REST and FastAPI. My second internship was at
        Rack Room Shoes in their eCommerce department where I assisted with A/B
        Testing, Online Merchandising, and Web Evaluation. Through these
        internships I have gained valuable skills, experience, and connections
        that I am excited to utilize for my future career.

        When I graduated High School in 2016, I moved and attended Middle
        Tennessee State University for about a year. I was studying Political
        Science and decided it was not what I wanted to pursue so I dropped out.
        After around 4 years, I returned to college at Cape Fear Community
        Science where I graduated in 2023 and received my Associate of Science.
        I then transferred to University of North Carolina Charlotte to finish
        my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

        During the Summer of 2024, I completed a course in Web-Development using
        Udemy. That helped me get a firm understanding of HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. I am excited to expand my existing knowledge and learn more
        about Web Development as a whole.

        ⤷ ITIS 3135 | Web App Design and Development: It is required, but I
        would have chosen it as an elective if not as Web Development is very
        fun and interesting to me. <br />⤷ ITCS 3112 | Design and Implementation
        of Object-Oriented Systems: I chose this as a technical elective as I
        wanted to gain more knowledge around object oriented programming.
        <br />⤷ ITCS 3160 | Database Design and Implementation: I am only taking
        this as it is required to complete my degree. <br />
        ⤷ ITCS 4102 | Programming Languages: I am taking this as technical
        elective primarily because I read you get to do a project using a non
        main-paradigm language. I thought it would be cool to learn a language
        that is up-and-coming. My group is currently building an application
        using Golang in this class. <br />
        ⤷ ITSC 3155 | Software Engineering: I am taking this so I can choose the
        Software Engineering capstone, and because Software Engineering is the
        career I would most like to have once I graduate. I knew it would teach
        me a lot about Software Development and would be a great step towards
        graduating.
